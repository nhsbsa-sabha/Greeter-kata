It's a simple greeting app which sends a greeting by taking input as name
It's sends greeting depending on the time for eg. if time in between 6am to 12pm it will say Good morning Saheba!
It will trim the space from the name and capitalise the first letter of the name
But if it's time in between 12pm to 6pm it will give out put as Hello Saheba!
